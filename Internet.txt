	+each major domain .org,.com,.net,... has a responsible DNS server

-UDP(User Datagram Protocol): get the package to right program (port)
	+checksum: allow data be checked correct by sum of data	
	+UDP doesn't fix data/ request new one if wrong, package is discarded by received program

-TCP(Transmission Control Protocol): 
	+package are numbered for reordering if scramble
	+package receive send ACK to acknowledge, if not send duplicate package
	+can send multiple package instead of waiting for ACK
	+can adjust transmission rate based on congestion


-IP(internet protocol): Ip get package to right computer
data is send by package not 1 file, follow IP standard

*SECURITY
-Protect"
	+Secrecy: only authorised people can access
	+integrity:		"	     use/ modify 		 
	+availability		"	     always have access
