- CRUD:	create, read, update, delete	
	-create: accounts, customer, purchases 
		+INSERT 
	-read: data user logs i, load up name and info
		+SELECT
		+SELECT DISTINCT: select only different value
	-update: e-mail address
		+UPDATE
	-delete: accounts
		+DELETE 

*DATA TYPE
- INT: whole number
- DECIMAL(M,N): decimal number - exact value (M: total digit stores, N: no digit stores after decimal point)
- VARCHAR(L): string of text of length l
- BLOB: binary large objec, stores large data
- DATE: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
- TIMESTAMP: 'YYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' - used for recording


*CONSTRAIN
- rule for data in table
- NOT NULL: 
- UNIQUE: value unique each row table/ rejected
- DEFAULT:
- AUTO_INCREMENT:


*UPDATE AND DELETE
-UPDATE tbl_name;
	SET	 
	WHERE	

-DELETE FROM tbl_name;
	WHERE






*QUERIES
- Block SQL ask system for info
- SELECT: get info
	+SELECT first_name AS forename, last_name AS surname
	+SELECT DISTINCT: n.o distinct value from table
	+SELECT COUNT:
	+SELECT AVG()/SUM(): average/ sum
- *: grab all data
- ORDER BY: ...  ASC/ DESC = ascending/ descending
- LIMIT: no of result
- WHERE: condition
	+ <, >, <=, >=, = , <>, AND, OR
	+ IN (value): pick data within value


*WILDCARDS
- subtitute one/ more character in string
- % = any #(number) characters
- _ = one character
- h[oa]t character within brackets {h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit}
- h[^oa]t character not brackets {h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat}
- c[a-b] range of characters {c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt}



*UNION
-combine multiple SELECT statements
 SELECT FROM
 UNION
 SELECT FROM
 UNION
 etc

-Rules: +same # column
	+same data type


*JOIN
- Combine rows 2/ more tables based on realted column
- JOIN: inner join
- LEFT JOIN: include all rows left table
- RIGHT JOIN: include all rows right table
- FULL OUTER JOIN: LEFT + RIGHT




*NESTED QUERY
- multiple SELECT



*ON DELETE
- ON DELETE SET NULL: value -> NULL, can't be used for PRIMARY KEY	
- ON DELETE CASCADE: delete row entire db, used for PRIMARY KEY






*TRIGGER
- Must used on MySQL command line client due to changing DELIMITED 
- Block SQL code defines certain action when certain operation performed on db
- DELIMITER: change SQL delimiter(;)
- NEW: row getting inserted
- DROP: discard trigger 






*ER(Entity Relationship) DIAGRAM
- Entity: object model & store info about 	R: square
- Attributes: specific pieces info of entity	R: oval
- Primary key: attribute uniquely identify entry in db table	R: oval, underlined
- Composite Attribute: attribute broken up -> sub-attributes	R: oval
- Multi-valued Attribute: attribute have more than 1 value	R: double oval
- Derived Attribute: derived other attributes			R: dotted oval
- Multiple Entities	
- Relationships: between 2 entities				R: diamond
- Participation:+ single line: partial participation		R: single/double line
		+ double line: total participation
- Relationship Attribute: attribute about relationship
- Relationship Cardinality: # instances entity associated with relation
		+ M : N: many vs many 
		+ 1 : 1: 1 vs 1
		+ 1 : N: 1 vs many
- Weak Entity: relies other entities to be identified		R: double square
	+ has total participation in identifying relationship
- Identifying relationship: serves uniquely identify weak entity | R:double diamond

+ER DESIGNING
- 1:1 : PRIMARY KEY favor total participation
- 1:N : 1 side PRIMARY KEY as FOREIGN KEY on N side 
- M:N : New table with composite key
